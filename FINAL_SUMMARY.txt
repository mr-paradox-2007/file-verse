EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - OFS Project

PROJECT: OMNI File System (OFS) Implementation
STATUS: COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL
DATE: January 1, 2026

OVERVIEW

The OFS project is a complete, production-grade file system implementation featuring:
- 100MB filesystem with block allocation

- Menu-driven CLI client with comprehensive testing interface
- SHA-256 user authentication with per-user salts
- Full file and directory operations
- Thread-safe logging with automatic rotation
- Complete documentation and testing framework

WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED

1. Core System Implementation
   - Filesystem manager with initialization and persistence
   - File operations (create, read, write, delete)
   - Directory operations (create, delete, list)
   - User authentication with cryptographic security
   - Permission management (Unix-style)
   - Metadata tracking and retrieval

2. Network Architecture
   - TCP server accepting multiple concurrent clients
   - Request/response protocol with proper error handling
   - Session management for authenticated users
   - Graceful shutdown procedures
   - Thread-based client handling

3. Client Interface Enhancement
   - Converted from simple command-line to hierarchical menu system
   - Five main menu categories for organized testing
   - Clear prompts and feedback for all operations
   - Status display and help system
   - Error handling with descriptive messages

4. Build and Test Infrastructure
   - Build script compiles all components successfully
   - Zero compilation errors
   - Automated test scripts for system verification
   - Manual testing guides with complete procedures
   - Test coverage for all major functionality

5. Documentation
   - User guide with detailed instructions
   - Architecture documentation with system design
   - Build instructions for reproducibility
   - Manual testing procedures and troubleshooting
   - Project completion summary
   - Quick start guide for immediate use
